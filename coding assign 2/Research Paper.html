          <p align="center">Do Video Games = Bad? Not necessarily.<br>
            It is common for individuals to say that video games,  specifically violent ones, are to blame for the way many children are.  Adults, especially parents tend to think that  A video game can impact a child negatively in many ways by exposing them to  harsh language, gore, sex, and illegal activities, among a multitude of other  things.  This absolutely can be true;  however, things can go the other way around as well.  As video games have also been shown to help  your mood, provide happiness, and in many cases, not impact individuals at all.<br>
            A study done  in 2021 took individuals and studied how video games affected their happiness levels  in a post-COVID-19 world.  Within the  study, researchers targeted adults who frequently play video games on digital  devices (computers, smartphones, consoles, etc.)  The study surveyed over two hundred  individuals and asked them questions relating to: the quality of the video  game, their emotions while playing (positive and negative were identified), and  most importantly, psychological well-being when partnered with the perceived  severity of COVID-19. Within this, the findings were as followed:  </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Individuals  relied on/expected psychological well-being from digital devices.</li>
            <li>If  they began thinking about the severity of their outside life, no psychological  well-being would occur.</li>
            <li>Video  games gave individuals positive well-being while playing the game, but not  necessarily afterward. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Later within  the findings, the researchers say that while emotions can elevate while playing  a video game, when individuals stop playing and come back to reality, those  emotions no longer control them (Kim, M. (2021). Assuming these emotions don&rsquo;t  go away, and do affect the rest of the player&rsquo;s day, how can they do so in a  positive way?  Why don&rsquo;t we hear about  the positive effects video games have?   The answer tends to fall on media bias, as many forms of media tend to  blame violent video games for many individuals acting out.  However, positives can emerge from entering a  digital world. <br>
            A study from  2014 used Seligman&rsquo;s PERMA positive psychology model in relation to video games  and mental well-being.  PERMA has five  facets: Positive emotion, engagement, relationships, meaning, and  accomplishment. Beginning with positive emotion, this study observed that teens  who played a moderate amount of video games a week (moderate being defined as  seven to ten hours a week) reported the best state of mental well-being.  The article even goes on to target boys in  particular and the effects video games - or the lack thereof - have on them.  &ldquo;Non-gaming has been found to put boys at  greater risk for problems. This effect for non-gamers has also been reported by  others who found gaming positively contributed to creative, social, and  emotional benefits...  However, it is the  amount of gameplay that appears significant with moderate gaming among young  men providing a healthy source of socialization, relaxation, and coping.&rdquo;  Jones, C., et al (2014). <br>
            I have been playing video games since I was five years  old.  I started playing on my GameCube in  2006.  I connected with friends, family,  and even my now husband over video games throughout my adolescence.  Other individuals seem to agree with  this.  Celia Hodent recently wrote an  article about the rising worry of violent video games, and how much time kids  are spending with video games in a pandemic world.  Hodent phrases it as follows: &ldquo;Overall, the  worries around video games seem greatly exaggerated. Video games, as a medium,  are neither good nor bad by themselves. It greatly depends on the specific  game, how it is consumed by the player, and why. Moreover, it is important to  keep in mind that social relationships are very important to teenagers, and in  today&rsquo;s world (especially during a pandemic), video games are where a lot of  social connections happen.&rdquo;<br>
            As Hodent said, video games are a medium and how they affect  someone depends on the person and the game they&rsquo;re playing.  Video games expertly craft storytelling with  music and visuals, to create a world that we could never imagine.  Not only do they serve to stimulate us  visually and emotionally, but also allow individuals to form social  connections, new memories, and even a new hobby.  Many games create a relaxing or fun  atmosphere such as Animal Crossing, Minecraft, or Stardew Valley.  While others provide more of a sense of  achievement through challenges such as Fortnite, It Takes Two, or Legend of  Zelda. Video games are an art form that continues to create happiness and  enjoyment in the lives of the individuals who play them no matter the genre.</p>
