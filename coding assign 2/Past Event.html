          <p>The Proposal<br>
            In August of 2020, my then-boyfriend, Samuel Boxdorfer,  took me on a date.  Underneath a tree, we  shared a picnic lunch, this was the same place where he had asked me to be his  girlfriend two years prior.  To his  surprise, on this date, I told him to propose to me, no ring needed, I just  wanted to be his wife.  He laughed and  came up with some reason to why he couldn&rsquo;t propose. I continued to ask him  throughout the date, and he got down on one knee and proposed, confessing he  had been waiting the whole day for the right moment to ask. <br>

          <p>Planning The Wedding</p>
          <p><br>
            We decided we wanted to get married in January of the  next year, leaving us roughly five months to plan our wedding.  Luckily, we knew we wanted a small wedding in  my hometown, at my home church.  Within  the first month of planning, we had everything set up, the colors would be  green and gold, the bridal party would consist of eight friends, our  photographer and pastor had been picked out, and everything was going smoothly-  until it wasn&rsquo;t.  Our photographer canceled  on us a month before the wedding, luckily a family friend stepped in to fill  the position.  On top of that, three days  before the wedding, our pastor canceled, he was stuck across the state in a  snowstorm.  Luckily, my father was in  seminary at the time and was able to get us in contact with a substitute pastor  who gladly stepped in.<br>
          </p>
          <p>Our Wedding Day</p>
          <p><br>
            At Noon on January 2nd, 2021, the wedding  began.  My husband, who does not cry  often, cried as I walked down the aisle.   The ceremony was a short twenty-five minutes, surrounded by a group of  twenty-five people including the pastor and bridal party.  We said our vows, kissed, and walk down the  aisle and out the main lobby doors with smiles on our faces.  When we reached the lobby, alone, we both  looked at each other and sighed a sigh of relief.  Everything had gone just fine.  Our bridal party, friends, and family all  came out to congratulate us on our marriage.   About forty minutes later we were signing our marriage certificate,  taking photos, and finally heading to the reception.  Our reception was held at my parent&rsquo;s local  business in Alton- just the bridal party, parents, and us.  We ate a small home-cooked meal, along with  our wedding cake, and had a wonderful conversation with the company.  By four o&rsquo;clock, the reception was over, and  we were headed home to our new apartment together for the first time.</p>
